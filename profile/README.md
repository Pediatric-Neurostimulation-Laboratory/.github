The Pediatric Neurostimulation Lab at Stanford University studies the relationship between various forms of pediatric epilepsy, cognition and learning. 
We examine benign rolandic epilepsy (BECTS) and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) through a variety of noninvasive methods, including electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with EEG. 
We hope to better understand how differences in brain excitation, plasticity and connectivity relate to difficulty with language, attention and learning in these conditions.
